      "description": "Issue Description:\nThis task supports the Code.gov team. We want to estimate total lines of code and total hours and costs for the code that is located in all of our open source repositories. The open source repositories are listed in the agency json files as shown on Code.gov.\n\nSpecific tasks:\n\nCount total lines of code for all open source repos on Code.gov using CLOC - https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc.\nDetermine labor hours and costs of total lines of code using the COCOMO II Model - http://csse.usc.edu/tools/cocomoii.php. Parameters TBD and can work with me (Joe Castle) on this.\nProvide all of this in a program/script that can be run on a regular basis to account for new code as it is added to Code.gov\nContact Info:\nName: Joseph Castle\nEmail: joseph.castle@gsa.gov",

The label shows up but the checkbox is hidden. The only way I can make it show up is to write a custom form only to flip the order of those elements to match your documentation.",
